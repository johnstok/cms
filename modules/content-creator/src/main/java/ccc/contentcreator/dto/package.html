Data transfer objects (DTOs) used by the content-creator application.
<br/>
The content-creator app doesn't use the full domain model defined in the
core-domain module. Firstly, the core domain depends on classes that GWT
can't yet serialise to javascript. Secondly, navigation in the core domain is
primarily by association rather than be query. As such it is unsuitable for
sending data of the appropriate size across the wire to the client.
