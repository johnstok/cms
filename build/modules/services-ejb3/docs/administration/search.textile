h1. Search

Content Control uses the Lucene engine to provide full text search capabilities.

h2. Index path

Lucene writes files to disk to store the search index. The folder location for lucene is stored in the settings table of the CC database. The install & upgrade scripts allow the index path location to be changed. The path can also be changed using the command line settings tool.

h2. Re-indexing

When a resource is created / updated Lucene will perform a re-index. All re-indexing happens asynchronously. Only affected resources are re-indexed following a resource change / update.

A JMS topic is used to store outstanding re-index operations. The necessary JMS topic is configured as a part of CC installation / upgrade.

h2. Clustered operation

When running multiple CC nodes in a cluster each node operates its own, independent Lucene index. The JMS topic that stores re-index events is clustered so the event is broadcast to all nodes to re-index.
