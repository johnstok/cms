<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

Taxonomy is used to categorise pages in CC7. There are three different parts of a taxonomy - vocabulary, template and page.

The vocabulary is a XML text file containing all the terms. There can be more than one vocabulary for a site.

In order to use that vocabulary the template must have a field of type 'taxonomy'. This field defines the path to the vocabulary file.

Finally, the page using a template with taxonomy field has a paragraph for selected taxonomy term IDs. These are stored as a comma separated list.



Template XML definition:
@<fields>@
    @<field name="category" type="taxonomy" vocabulary="/assets/transport" />@
@</fields>@

Example taxonomy vocabulary
