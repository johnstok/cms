h1. Full text search

Content Control uses "Lucene":http://lucene.apache.org to provide full text search capabilities.

h2. Searching for resources

Access to the search engine is available in all templates via the @$services@ object. See documentation of the "search":ccc.api.core.SearchEngine class for full details of the methods available.

bc. #set( $search=$services.getSearch() )
#set ($result = find("content control", 20, 0);
<ul>
#foreach( $hit in $result.hits() )
    <li>$hit</li>
#end
</ul>

Query methods on the search engine always return a "search result":ccc.api.types.SearchResult object containing hits that match the search term.

Each hit is the unique identifier of a resource in control. You could look up the resource using the "resources":ccc.api.coreResources object. For example:

bc. #set( $resource=$services.getResources().retrieve($hit) )

Query methods are always paged, the above snippet returns the first 20 results from the first (0th) page. If necessary you can implement "paging":paging.html to scroll through subsequent results.

h2. Syntax for search terms.

For simple searches it should be enough to pass one or more terms to the search engine:

bc. "Java"
"Content Control"
"Content Management System"

Lucene uses a tokeniser to split terms such as "open-source" (it would be equivalent to "open source").

It is also possible to search on specific fields of a resource:

bc. "title:blog"
"tags:news"

For full details of the search term syntax see the Lucene "query syntax":http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_2/queryparsersyntax.html.

h2. Available fields

h3. All resources

|*title*|The resource's title|
|*id*|The unique identifier of the resource|
|*path*|The absolute path for the resource (e.g. /blog/my-first-post)|
|*name*|The resource's name|
|*tags*|The resource's tags|
|*type*|The type of the resource|
|*date_created*|The date the resource was created|
|*date_changed*|The date the resource was last changed|
|*allcontent*|All of the resources text content. For a page this will include all paragraphs. For files it will include all text within the file.|

h3. Pages

A field will be created for each paragraph on the page. So, for example, if page has a paragraph named 'article' you could search in the article paragraph with the following query:

bc. "article:Java"

If the paragraph contains text content both tokenised and un-tokenised fields are created. Un-tokenised fields are prefixed with an underscore (e.g. '_article'). This simplifies some queries such as "starts with". For example, to find all articles that start with a T you could use the following search:

bc. "_article:T*"

Un-tokenised text fields are also useful when sorting textual paragraphs.
