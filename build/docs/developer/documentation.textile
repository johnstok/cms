h1. Documentation

All documentation for CC will be managed under version control. This means that you can be sure that the documentation bundled with a specific release is relevant.

All documentation will be written in Textile.

h2. Layout

Documentation will be provided for each CC module, located in a 'docs' folder. Different documentation is relevant to different CC users, therefore, we will add a number of sub-folders containing documentation relevant to different user types as follows:

* editor
* build
* administrator
* developer
