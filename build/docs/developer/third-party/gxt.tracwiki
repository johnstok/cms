http://extjs.com/products/gxt/

Their forum is active and well written bug reports are usually not ignored: http://extjs.net/forum/

== Best practices ==

=== GWT ===
Avoid mixing GWT and GXT elements.

=== Performance ===
http://sinnema313.wordpress.com/2008/11/16/performance-tuning-a-gwt-application/

=== Close vs Hide ===
For GXT only: http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=48834&highlight=hide+close
'''GXT 2.0 deprecated close method'''

GWT does not have close method for dialogs/windows.

=== SetId ===
Allows Selenium to find the right element

=== Validation ===

=== Grid vs Table ===

Grid is much more light weight and therefore faster to render. For rendering ID for Grid check [wiki:Selenium#Grid]

=== Rich Text Editor ===
Check [wiki:FCKEditor]
=== Abstract classes ===

== Upgrade to 2.0 ==

 - Replace deprecated close methods with hide.
 - After replacing close methods with hide, check listeners using Event.Close. Change those to Event.Hide.
 - Do not use spaces in component IDs.
 - Menus seem to have autoscroll=on as default and root menus did not display at all because of this.
 - GXTs css and images are now separated from jar, check GXT 2.0 migration guide.
 - Existing trees should be replaced with TreePanel.
