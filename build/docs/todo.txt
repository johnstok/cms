Transactions
 File upload servlets don't rollback txns!!!

Fold password into user, use jBoss security mgr?
Working copies
 Should be using deltas
 FileDelta should return working copy if set...
 Review working copy stuff - borked.
 Make sure all commands are logged.


!!
Add Migrations EJB only accessible by ADMIN
Pull in source for json.org json lib and send to client, add contructors for model data classes that accept json
Action scheduler is a security risk - can potentially elevate privileges.
Rename model data subclasses
Factor remaining actions from ResourceContextMenu
UpdateFileServlet should return ZLS on success (or json NULL - equiv to returning NULL from a Void method)
search indexing -> search between dates, etc.
search resource is in the wrong place
login page is hardcoded
Remove targetName from alias delta, look up name from targetId on the client side
