!!!
Fold password into user, use jBoss security mgr?
Working copies
 Should be using deltas
 FileDelta should return working copy if set...
 Review working copy stuff - borked.
 Make sure all commands are logged.


!!
Best way to persist exceptions for Action?
Pull in source for json.org json lib and send to client, add contructors for model data classes that accept json
Rename model data subclasses
Factor remaining actions from ResourceContextMenu
UpdateFileServlet should return ZLS on success (or json NULL - equiv to returning NULL from a Void method)
search indexing -> search between dates, etc.
login page is hardcoded
Remove targetName from alias delta, look up name from targetId on the client side


!
Audit logging
 Move factory methods on LogEntry to individual command classes.
Public API types:
 res path
 res name
 ResourceOrder
 mime type
 password
 email
 paragraph
 comment
Move LogEntry creation to commands.
data manager rename fo file manager
move DTOs into ccc.domain.dto
move value type into ccc.domain.types
move entities into ccc.domain.entities?
