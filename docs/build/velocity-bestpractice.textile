h2. Velocity best practices

Use #parse only for resources that have Velocity code, otherwise use #include.

Place macros in a single file, for example snippets.vm

Use existing API methods as much as possible - avoid reinventing wheel in Velocity.

Avoid fetching huge amount of data to be processed in Velocity, this will ruin performance.

If you need a functionality that cannot be implemented in Velocity, try server side JavaScript.

Macro output can be stored into a $variable, but it requires special notation: #set($variable = "#myMacro")
