h2. Velocity best practices

* Use #parse only for resources that have Velocity code, otherwise use #include.

* Place macros in a single file, for example snippets.vm

* Use existing API methods as much as possible - avoid reinventing wheel in Velocity.

* Avoid fetching huge amount of data to be processed in Velocity, this will ruin performance.

* If you need a functionality that cannot be implemented in Velocity, try server side JavaScript.

* Macro output can be stored into a $variable, but it requires special notation: #set($variable = "#myMacro")

* Empty list can be created with #set($myList = []), empty map can be created with #set($myMap = {}).

* Some Java methods return true and that might end up in the rendered webpage. Use #call macro to silence the output.

* Use following to parse String into Integer: #set($intString = "2011") #set($Integer = 0) $Integer.parseInt($intString)
