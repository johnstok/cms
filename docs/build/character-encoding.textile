Default charset for CC is UTF-8.
All pages generated by templates sent in UTF-8.
All request URIs are interpreted as UTF-8.
All API calls are assumed to be UTF-8 unless an alternative is specified.
All response bodies are assumed to be UTF-8 unless an alternative is specified.

Forms must be served in UTF-8 then browsers will submit in UTF-8.

Practicalities
When browsers send multipart/formdata for non-ascii char's they don't respect char encoding from the mime spec for "name" or "filename" properties. E.g. you can send a filename of '案例学习.jpg' Firefox and IE don't even escape the " char which can lead to invalid request bodies.
