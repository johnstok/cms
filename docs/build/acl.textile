<h2>ACL</h2>

Access control can be configured on groups or on users. By default, new resource does not have any groups or users assigned and therefore anyone can read and modify it. 

By assigning a group to a resource only members of that group can access the resource. 

By assigning an user to a resource only that user can access the resource.

There can be any combination of users and groups, see table below.

|_. group |_. user |_. who can access |
| admin | | only members of admin group |
| admin | john |	members of admin group and john |
| admin | john,lisa | members of admin group, john and lisa |

The default assigned group or user gets read and write permission (R+W) for the resource.

Read and write permissions can be changed but with *caution*. 
Assigning read only permissions will *lock* resource and other hand a resource with only write permissions is *invisible*. Only admin users can change access rights in these cases.
