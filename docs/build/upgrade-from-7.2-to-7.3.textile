h2. Upgrade from 7.2  to 7.3

h3. Resources.exists no longer available

In 7.2 it was recommended  to call resources.exists before resources.retrieve in order to avoid exception .  This method does not exist anymore. In 7.3 the resources.retrieve will return @null@ if no resource found.

h3. Modify page parameter handling for Lucene searches

The first page of search results is now 1 instead of 0 so it behaves like resource searches. Update paging control to handle this properly.

h3. Replace search resource with a page if necessary

In 7.3 the search resource has been removed. If the site search was using that then it needs to be replaced with a page. The template used for the resource needs to be modified to do the search based on the search parameters.
For example add:

bc. 
#set($query = $request.getParameter("q"))
#set($search=$services.getSearch())
#set($results = $search.find($query, 20, 0);

h3. Velocity Tools $dateTool and $sortTool are removed.

Use $calendar (java.util.Calendar) or $collections (java.util.Collections) .

h3. Replace Actions.listCompletedActions and listPendingActions

Use Actions.listActions instead.

h3. Modify Files.getPagedImages method calls

Replace folder id with ResourceCriteria object.
