<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

Taxonomy is used to categorise pages in CC7. There are three different parts of a taxonomy - vocabulary, template and page.

The vocabulary is a XML text file containing all the terms. There can be more than one vocabulary for a site. The mime type for the taxonomy file should be  application/vnd.cc.vocabulary.1+xml

In order to use that vocabulary the template must have a field of type 'taxonomy'. This field defines the path to the vocabulary file.

Finally, the page using a template with taxonomy field has a paragraph for selected taxonomy term IDs. These are stored as a comma separated list.



Template XML definition:
@<fields>@
    @<field name="category" type="taxonomy" vocabulary="/assets/transport" />@
@</fields>@

Example taxonomy vocabulary
File path /assets/transport

@<vocabulary>@
  @<term id="1" title="ground">@
    @<term id="1.1" title="car"/>@
    @<term id="1.2" title="truck"/>@
  @</term>@
  @<term id="2" title="air">@
    @<term id="2.1" title="plane"/>@
    @<term id="2.2" title="helicopter"/>@
