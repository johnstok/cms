h1. CC Database Schema

A description of the key tables in the CC database schema and how they are used.

h2. General Points

* All DB identifiers are type 4 UUIDs.
* The VN column found in a number of tables is used by the ORM layer to provide optimistic offline locking and can be ignored for migration purposes.

h2. Users

* Each user has a record in the USERS table.
* User groups are store in the GROUPS table.
* A user can belong to multiple groups recorded in the USER_ROLES join table.
* Additional user metadata may be available in the USER_METADATA table.
* A group can be assigned 0 or more permissions, determing the commands a user can perform.

h2. Resources

* CC stores 6 different subtypes of resources: Aliases, Files, Folders, Pages, Searches and Templates.
* All resources have an entry in the RESOURCES table.
* An additional table for each resource subtype is available. Matching a record in the RESOURCE and the subtype table can be achieved by joining on their respective ID columns.
* Resources are stored hierarchically. A resouce's parent is specified by the PARENT_ID column.
* Root folders have a null value for PARENT_ID.
* The order of resources in a parent is specified by the PARENT_INDEX column.
* For pages, files and templates a revision history is kept. Each revision is stored in the corresponding revison table, e.g. PAGE_REVISIONS.
* The order of revisions is specified by the REVISION_NO column. Revision no's are specified by a sequence starting from 0.
* To identify the current revsion for a subtype you should join against the subtype's ID and REVISION_NO columns.
* Pages and files may also have a working copy specified in their respective wcopies table (e.g. PAGE_WCOPIES). However, for migration purposes these can likely be ignored.
* File data is not stored in the database. Instead a file is written to disk with a filename corresponding to the value of the DATA_ID column from a record in the FILE_REVISIONS table.
* CC implements soft delete. Deleted resources are identified by a non-zero / true value in the DELETED column.
* Each revision of a page contains 0 or more paragraphs, stored in the PAGE_REVISION_PARAGRAPHS table.
* Each paragraph has a name, a type and a value.
* Paragraphs can be one of several types: 
** TEXT    Stored in the VALUE_TEXT column.
** BOOLEAN Stored in the VALUE_BOOLEAN column.
** DATE    Stored in the VALUE_DATE column.
** NUMBER  Encoded using java.math.BigDecimal#toString() method and stored in the VALUE_TEXT column.
** LIST    Comma delimited and stored in the VALUE_TEXT column.
* By default a resource is accessible to everyone. If a users / groups are assigned to a resource it will be visible only if the user matches one of assigned subjects.
* The RESOURCE_ROLES and RESOURCE_USERS tables record the groups and users assigned to a resource, respectively.

h2. Comments

* Comments are stored in a single table COMMENTS.
* Each comment refers to a resource, specified by the RESOURCE_ID column.

h2. Actions

* Actions are commands scheduled to execute at a later data. These can likely be ignored for migration.
