h1. Content Control System Architecture

Content Control is a modular content management platform. A suite of applications are provided to suit different purposes:

* A content management server, accessible via HTTP
* A content management client that can access CC servers via HTTP
* A set of server administration tools
* A set of migration tools for 3rd party systems.
