h1. Software Process

h2. Summary

We will be using XP to develop CCC7. For an introduction to XP see "wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming.":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming.

h2. Our implementation

* 2 weekly iterations.
* End of iteration Fri 5pm
* Release and planning on a Monday morning

h2. Practices used

* Unit testing (jUnit)
* Acceptance testing ("SeleniumRC":SeleniumRC)
* Pair programming (as required)
* Refactoring
* Simple design
* Collective code ownership
* Continuous integration
* On site customer
* Small releases
* Sustainable pace
* Coding standard
* Mission statement
* Ubiquitous language
* User stories

h2. Code review

* We will run monthly code reviews.
* We'll document our [StrategyCodeReview code review strategy].

h2. User stories

* User stories will be written using Mike Cohn's *As a user, I want* style.
* For more information on user stories see the [XpPractices XP practices page].

h2. How we estimate

* We will estimate story size in 'story points'
* We will use fibonacci numbers for estimates (ie 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...)

h3. What detail should form part of an estimate?

All delivery activities:
* Planning
* Architecture discussions / design decisions
* Technical spike
* Unit tests
* Coding
* Documentation
* Deployment considerations: DB upgrade required, etc.
* Acceptance tests required
* Libraries to be selected or integrated
