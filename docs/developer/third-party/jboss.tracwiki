= How to start Jboss in 'all' server setup =

./run.sh -c all -b 0.0.0.0 -g petteri -Djboss.messaging.ServerPeerID=0 -u 233.3.4.79

where 
-c is server configuration name
-u is Bind address for all JBoss services
-g is HA Partition name (default=DefaultDomain) 
-u is UDP multicast address

In order to have several Jboss instances behave orderly in a LAN you must have unique multicast address. Otherwise JBoss instances start to communicate with each other.
