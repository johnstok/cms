= GWT integration =

Currently done with jwc-gwt-fckeditor version 0.2.2 from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=169388 
Passing information to dialog from GXT resource selection dialogues is done with native javascript call.

= Customizing FCKEditor =

'''IMPORTANT'''

Do not edit fckconfig.js directly. Edit ccc_config.js instead. This allows us to keep FCKEditor updated without tedious merging.

Do not edit FCKeditor sources directly. Instead create a plugin and add a new button to the tool bar.
