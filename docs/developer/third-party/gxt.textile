h3. Close vs Hide

For GXT only: "http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=48834&highlight=hide+close":http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=48834&highlight=hide+close
*GXT 2.0 deprecated close method*

GWT does not have close method for dialogs/windows.

h3. SetId

Allows Selenium to find the right element

h3. Validation


h3. Grid vs Table


Grid is much more light weight and therefore faster to render. For rendering ID for Grid check "Selenium#Grid":selenium.html#Grid

h3. Rich Text Editor

Check "FCKEditor":fck-editor.html

h3. Abstract classes


h2. Upgrade to 2.0

* Replace deprecated close methods with hide.
* After replacing close methods with hide, check listeners using Event.Close. Change those to Event.Hide.
* Do not use spaces in component IDs.
* Menus seem to have autoscroll=on as default and root menus did not display at all because of this.
* GXTs css and images are now separated from jar, check GXT 2.0 migration guide.
* Existing trees should be replaced with TreePanel.
