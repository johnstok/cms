h2. Firefox profile for Selenium


# Quit Firefox in case it is running.
# Execute @firefox -profilemanager -no-remote@
# The profile manager will pop up. Click ‘Create profile...’ and make a new profile called ‘Selenium’ (mind your spelling and case). Make sure that Firefox asks you every time you start it.
# Click ‘Exit’.
# Execute @firefox -P Selenium -no-remote@
# A new firefox window will pop up
# Go to Preferences → Advanced → Network → Connection Settings... (based on Firefox 3 for Linux, your mileage may vary).
# Set the HTTP proxy to be localhost, port 5555.  
# Make sure the proxy settings in Firefox "no proxy for" is empty.
# Turn off form auto filling and activate "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox".
# Change the browser.sessionstore.enabled setting in Firefox.
## type about:config in your browser URL
## go to the browser.sessionstore.enabled setting
## change the setting to false
# Quit Firefox.
