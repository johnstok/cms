h2. Deployment

This page covers two typical deployment scenarios for CC7 during development.

h3. Local deployment with development version

This is the common case where a developer deploys latest version to the local JBoss to verify code changes and to run acceptance tests before commit or release.

In case you want to use H2 "memory only" as your database, start it in the build directory @.../CCC7/build@ by executing @h2.cmd@.
Other databases do not need this step and the DB connections parameters are read from the ~/.m2/settings.xml.

Make sure you have running JBoss instance. Start Jboss from Eclipse, there should be a run target if the Jboss project is imported correctly.
After Jboss is up and running,  on the command line execute: @mvn clean install -P deploy,configure@.

The web site itself is accessible at "http://localhost:8080{application.name}":http://localhost:8080{application.name}.
The content control user interface is be available at "http://localhost:8080{application.name}/ccc/client/":http://localhost:8080{application.name}/ccc/client/.


h3. Remote deployment with development version

Remote deployment is necessary when CC7 has to be deployed on a cluster. This can be the case under development for example when load testing is taking place.

h4. 1. Create assembly

mvn clean install -P assemble

h4. 2. Copy assembly and install/upgrade the application on the server

Create a directory to /webhome/docs/xxxx where xxxx is the application name.
Copy the new ear file (/modules/application-ear/target/cc7-release.zip) to the server in that directory.
Unzip the file on the server and delete the cc-release.zip.

Only in case of new installation - run /installer/install.sh and /installer/post_install.sh
To upgrade existing installation - run /installer/upgrade.sh

h4. 3. Deploy

Create symbolic link in to Jboss server deploy directory ln -s /webhome/docs/xxxx/xxxx.ear /usr/local/jboss/server/standard/deploy/xxxx.ear
Observe server log to monitor deployment tail -f /usr/local/jboss/server/standard/log/server.log
Configure jBoss logging to send output to a separate appender.

h4. 4. Migration (optional)

Migrate data from cc6 using the command line tool.
Create upgraded templates for migrated data.

h4. 5. Start tasks

start lucene indexing: java -cp client-shell-7.2.20-SNAPSHOT.jar ccc.cli.Search -a xxxx -p migration -u migration -c start
start scheduler: java -cp client-shell-7.2.20-SNAPSHOT.jar ccc.cli.Scheduling -a xxxx -p migration -u migration -c start

h4. 6. Configure Apache

Configure Apache to provide reverse-proxying etc. depending on the setup.


h2. Command line tools

Tools output possible options when executed without options. Read "shell tools":../../administration/shell-tools.html for more information.

h2. Apache HTTP server

Read separate page about configuration: "HowToConfigApacheHTTPServer":/ccc7/wiki/HowToConfigApacheHTTPServer

h2. Acceptance testing

Check the "testing strategy document":../testing/testing-strategy.html.

h2. Database schema

During development the DB schema can be recreated using 'configure' mvn profile.

The latest schema definitions can be exported using 'schema' profile under services-ejb3: @mvn clean install -P schema@.

DB scripts are stored under db-schema module and it produces zip file containing all scripts.
